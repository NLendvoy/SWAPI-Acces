# SWAPI-Info Access
A React.js based web app to access and display some information about all characters in the SWAPI database.

## How to run:

Install node package manager here: https://nodejs.org/en/  
To create static server on your local network, in the project directory use:  
- npm install -g serve
- serve -s build

This will give all devices on your local network access through port 5000 or the host device at localhost:5000
